## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Testing

1. **Navigate to the project**
   ```bash
   cd Lawmatics-MCP
   ```

2. **Verify installation** (already done)
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configure API key**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   nano .env
   # Replace: LAWMATICS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```

4. **Inspect the server**
   ```bash
   uv run fastmcp inspect cloud.py:mcp
   ```

5. **Run test workflow**
   ```bash
   uv run python test_phone_search.py
   ```

6. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   uv run python -m app
   # Server runs on http://localhost:8000/mcp/
   ```

### FastMCP Cloud Deployment

#### Step 1: Prepare Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial Lawmatics MCP Server implementation"

# Add remote (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/lawmatics-mcp.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 2: Deploy on FastMCP Cloud

1. **Visit FastMCP Cloud**
   - Go to https://fastmcp.cloud
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Configure deployment:

   ```
   Project Name: lawmatics-mcp
   Entrypoint:   cloud.py:mcp
   Branch:       main
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Add these environment variables in the FastMCP Cloud dashboard:

   ```env
   LAWMATICS_API_KEY=your_actual_lawmatics_api_key_here
   LAWMATICS_BASE_URL=https://api.lawmatics.com/v1/
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: Get your API key from:
   - Log into Lawmatics
   - Navigate to Settings → API
   - Generate or copy your API key

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - FastMCP Cloud will:
     - Clone your repository
     - Install dependencies
     - Build and start the server
     - Provide URL: `https://lawmatics-mcp.fastmcp.app/mcp`

#### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Check deployment logs in FastMCP Cloud dashboard
2. Look for successful startup messages:
   ```
   Setting up Lawmatics MCP server sub-servers
   Imported search server tools
   Imported get server tools
   Imported manage server tools
   Server setup complete - all sub-servers loaded
   ```

3. Test the deployed server:
   ```bash
   curl https://lawmatics-mcp.fastmcp.app/mcp/health
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Phone Search Feature

The project includes a test script that demonstrates the requested functionality:

### Test: "Find all matters associated with the phone number 714-917-5140"

```bash
uv run python test_phone_search.py
```

**What This Test Does:**

1. **Searches for contacts** with phone number 714-917-5140
2. **Extracts contact details**: name, email, status, ID
3. **For each contact**, searches for associated matters
4. **Displays matter details**: name, status, practice area
5. **Provides summary**: total contacts and matters found

**Expected Workflow** (with valid API key):

```
Step 1: search_contacts(phone="714-917-5140")
  → Returns list of contacts matching this phone

Step 2: For each contact:
  → Display contact information

Step 3: search_matters(contact_id=<each_contact_id>)
  → Returns matters for that contact

Step 4: Summary
  → Total contacts found
  → Total matters found
  → Details for each matter
```

### Using the MCP Prompt

Alternatively, you can use the built-in prompt via any MCP client:

```
Prompt: find-contact-by-phone
Parameters: {phone_number: "714-917-5140"}
```

This will guide the LLM through the same workflow automatically.

## 🔒 Security Notes

### API Key Management

1. **Local Development**
   - Store API key in `.env` file (git ignored)
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
   - Use `.env.example` as template

2. **FastMCP Cloud**
   - Set API key as environment variable in dashboard
   - Environment variables are encrypted at rest
   - Not exposed in logs or responses

3. **Best Practices**
   - Rotate API keys periodically
   - Use different keys for dev/staging/production
   - Monitor API usage in Lawmatics dashboard
   - Contact api@lawmatics.com for API support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"LAWMATICS_API_KEY not found"**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists and contains valid key
   - For FastMCP Cloud, check environment variables in dashboard
   - Verify key is not expired or revoked

2. **"HTTP 401 Unauthorized"**
   - API key is invalid or expired
   - Get new key from Lawmatics settings
   - Verify no extra spaces in the key value

3. **"HTTP 404 Not Found"**
   - Entity ID doesn't exist
   - Check if resource has been deleted
   - Verify correct ID format

4. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify Lawmatics API is accessible
   - Increase timeout in config.py if needed

5. **Tools not loading**
   - Run `fastmcp inspect cloud.py:mcp`
   - Check for import errors in logs
   - Verify all dependencies installed: `uv sync`
