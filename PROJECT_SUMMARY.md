## 🎨 Design Highlights

### 1. Server Composition Pattern
Following the battle-tested CourtListener architecture:
- Main server coordinates 3 sub-servers
- Lazy loading for optimal performance
- No tool name conflicts
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. LLM-Optimized Descriptions
Every tool includes:
- Clear one-line summary
- Detailed explanation of use cases
- When to use this tool vs. alternatives
- Complete parameter documentation
- Example workflows in prompts

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
```python
try:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(...)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
    # Log and raise with context
except Exception as e:
    # Catch-all with logging
```

### 4. Type Safety
```python
async def search_contacts(
    name: Annotated[str, Field(description="Search for contacts by name")] = "",
    email: Annotated[str, Field(description="Search by email")] = "",
    phone: Annotated[str, Field(description="Search by phone")] = "",
    limit: Annotated[int, Field(description="Max results", ge=1, le=100)] = 20,
    ctx: Context | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
```

### 5. Resource Templates
Direct URI access to entities:
```
lawmatics://contacts/12345
lawmatics://matters/67890
lawmatics://tasks/abc123
lawmatics://companies/xyz789
```

### 6. Guided Prompts
Pre-built workflows for:
- Finding contacts by phone
- Matter overview and analysis
- Client onboarding
- Daily task summaries
- Billing reports
- Matter search and analysis

**MCP Workflow**:
1. Use `search_contacts` tool with `phone="714-917-5140"`
2. Extract contact IDs from results
3. For each contact, use `search_matters` with `contact_id`
4. Aggregate and present all associated matters

**Or Use Prompt**:
```
Prompt: find-contact-by-phone
Params: {phone_number: "714-917-5140"}
```
The LLM follows the workflow automatically.
