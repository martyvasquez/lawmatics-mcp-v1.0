"""FastMCP Cloud entrypoint for Lawmatics MCP Server.

This file serves as the deployment entrypoint for FastMCP Cloud.
FastMCP Cloud will automatically discover and host the 'mcp' instance.

Usage in FastMCP Cloud:
    - Entrypoint: cloud.py:mcp
    - The server will be available at: https://your-project-name.fastmcp.app/mcp
    - Configure LAWMATICS_API_KEY as an environment variable in FastMCP Cloud settings

For local development and testing:
    - fastmcp dev cloud.py:mcp
    - fastmcp inspect cloud.py:mcp
    - Or run: python -m app

Note: This entrypoint eagerly loads all sub-servers at module import time
so that FastMCP Cloud and inspection tools can discover all available tools.
